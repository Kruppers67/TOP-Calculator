Hello and thank you for taking some time to look at my work.

So this project was one that I initially struggled with. The first time I did it, I copied, pasted, copied, pasted until things somewhat made sense. But it was not my own. I grasped at straws to watch videos, follow tutorials. Find help in chatgpt, etc. But understanding what I was doing did not end anywhere nice.

This time around. however, I still had to utilize google and chatgpt to understand methods, layouts, and simple mechanisms. But most of my code (about 90%) is mine. This, for me, was a huge win in this project, and Im very excited to move forward with my knowledge and better understanding.

The code you see in CSS and HTML are all my own code, but I did utilize chatgpt for the clearAll methods AFTER attempting it myself, then of which, I had help in refining it and fixing bugs.

Please check out my linked in, my other works, and whatever else is on my github to see further what my skills hold!

Happy coding!
